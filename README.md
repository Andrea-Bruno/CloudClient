# Trustless cloud client

## The project is centered with a military safety standard.

# Easy to use Cloud Client + Backup Drive (Bonus)!

Cross-platform desktop cloud client, for compatible clouds (works in conjunction with cloud server to sync files).
This project has dependencies with other libraries which you can find open source in the same account as separate projects as the underlying libraries are in common with other projects:
Therefore, the projects not included can be added by searching for them on the github repository, some are also available as nughet packages (you can add them to the solution instead of the missing projects).
If you don't have the Cloud Server, alternatively you can use this software with a network address as a remote repository (the path must be set in the "git" parameter under the backup settings), for example you can set a pen drive connected to your router (in this case, the samba network path of the pen drive must be entered in "git").

# Privacy Policy

The application does not collect or send personal data, all communication is exclusively with your private cloud or cloud service.
Since the privacy policy is trustless (you don't have to trust us but it is the code that demonstrates honesty), the source code irrefutably demonstrates that our work is sincere and loyal and that your data is protected, and the communications between client and Cloud server are impossible to intercept because they are covered by military-grade encryption systems with digitally signed packets to prevent "man in the middle" attacks in a preventive manner. The versions that we publish on the store are the same (without any modifications) that you can find here in source format.

## dependencies:

The libraries that are the engine of this app (and represent a dependency), must be downloaded from here:

* [Cloud Library](https://github.com/Andrea-Bruno/CloudLibraries) are libraries for the creation of symmetric cloud (with server and equal client).

* [Encrypted Messenging](https://github.com/Andrea-Bruno/EncryptedMessaging) are Low-level libraries for trustless encrypted socket connection (derived from bitcoin technology).

* [Secure Storage](https://github.com/Andrea-Bruno/SecureStorage) It is a library used to save data and information produced by the application in an encrypted and inaccessible way.

* [AntiGit](https://github.com/Andrea-Bruno/AntiGithub) , in this project you will find the libraries used for the data backup and redundancy functions.

NOTE: Any other (possible) dependencies are on [our GitHub](https://github.com/Andrea-Bruno) in source format.

The reasons that led to this project with dontnet is that it is an open source development environment, and effective security is achieved only by being able to inspect all parts of the code, including the development framework.
* [.NET is open source](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/open-source)

Our target is very linux and unix oriented, and the partnership between Microsoft and Canonical ensure the highest standard of security and reliability.

* [Microsoft and Canonical: partnering for security](https://ubuntu.com/blog/install-dotnet-on-ubuntu)

* [Red Hat works with Microsoft to ensure new major versions and service releases are available in tandem with Microsoft releases](https://developers.redhat.com/products/dotnet/overview)

Friendly projects for which we underline the importance of maintaining computer privacy:

* [DuckDuckGo (DDG)](https://duckduckgo.com/) is an internet search engine that emphasizes protecting searchers' privacy and avoiding the filter bubble of personalized search results.

* [The tor project](https://www.torproject.org/): is a Seattle-based 501 nonprofit organization founded by computer scientists Roger Dingledine, Nick Mathewson, and five others. The Tor Project is primarily responsible for maintaining software for the Tor anonymity network. 

* [Kali linux](https://www.kali.org/): is a Debian-derived Linux distribution designed for digital forensics and penetration testing. It is maintained and funded by Offensive Security.

* [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/): is an Android-based operating system for smartphones, tablet computers, and set-top boxes, with mostly free and open-source software.
