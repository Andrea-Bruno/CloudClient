# Trustless claud client

## The project is centered with a military safety standard.

# Easy to use Cloud Client + Backup Drive (Bonus)!

Cross-platform desktop cloud client, for compatible clouds (works in conjunction with cloud server to sync files).
This project has dependencies with other libraries which you can find open source in the same account as separate projects as the underlying libraries are in common with other projects:
Therefore, the projects not included can be added by searching for them on the github repository, some are also available as nughet packages (you can add them to the solution instead of the missing projects).
If you don't have the Cloud Server, alternatively you can use this software with a network address as a remote repository (the path must be set in the "git" parameter under the backup settings), for example you can set a pen drive connected to your router (in this case, the samba network path of the pen drive must be entered in "git").
